This is my university project for the IN1007 module and I created this game called Just Dodge.

This is a game that enforces law of physics. There is gravity, friction, force, etc.

Controls are...
ASD - movement
Spacebar - jump

The aim is to pick up all the collectibles until stage 4 and dodge all the enemies you encounter. Trust me it gets harder every stage.

Have fun and enjoy!
